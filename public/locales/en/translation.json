  "dalton_title": "Dalton's Model (1803)",
  "dalton_description": "John Dalton proposed that matter is composed of atoms, which he imagined as solid, indivisible, and indestructible spheres.",
  "dalton_experiment": "Based on ponderal laws and proportions of chemical reactions, not on a single definitive experiment.",
  "dalton_limitations": "It did not explain the electrical nature of matter, the existence of subatomic particles, or why atoms combine.",
  "thomson_title": "Thomson's Model (1897)",
  "thomson_description": "After the discovery of the electron, J.J. Thomson proposed the 'plum pudding' model, where the atom would be a sphere of positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded in it.",
  "thomson_experiment": "Experiments with cathode ray tubes, which led to the discovery of the electron and the measurement of its charge-to-mass ratio.",
  "thomson_limitations": "It did not explain the stability of the atom or the distribution of the positive charge, which was proven not to be diffuse.",
  "rutherford_title": "Rutherford's Model (1911)",
  "rutherford_description": "Ernest Rutherford's planetary model describes the atom with a very small, dense, and positive central nucleus, with electrons orbiting around it.",
  "rutherford_experiment": "The famous 'gold foil experiment', where alpha particles were bombarded against a thin gold foil. Most passed straight through, but some deflected drastically, indicating a dense nucleus.",
  "rutherford_limitations": "According to classical physics, an orbiting electron should radiate energy, collapsing into the nucleus in a fraction of a second, which does not happen. The model did not guarantee atomic stability.",
  "bohr_title": "Bohr's Model (1913)",
  "bohr_description": "Niels Bohr improved Rutherford's model by proposing that electrons move in circular orbits with quantized and defined energy levels. An electron only radiates energy when it jumps from one level to another.",
  "bohr_experiment": "Based on the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom, which showed discrete lines instead of a continuous spectrum, indicating specific energy levels.",
  "bohr_limitations": "It worked perfectly only for the hydrogen atom and did not explain why the energy levels were quantized or the behavior of more complex atoms.",
  "sommerfeld_title": "Sommerfeld's Model (1916)",
  "sommerfeld_description": "Arnold Sommerfeld refined Bohr's model by introducing elliptical orbits and the azimuthal quantum number (l), explaining the fine lines in the atomic spectrum.",
  "sommerfeld_experiment": "Analysis of emission spectra with high-resolution spectrometers, which revealed that Bohr's spectral lines were actually composed of multiple finer lines.",
  "sommerfeld_limitations": "Although it was an advance, it was still a classical model with quantum corrections and did not completely explain all phenomena, such as the anomalous Zeeman Effect.",
  "schrodinger_title": "Schrödinger's Model (1926)",
  "schrodinger_description": "Erwin Schrödinger described the electron as a probability wave. The model does not define a trajectory, but a region in space (an orbital) where there is the highest probability of finding the electron.",
  "schrodinger_experiment": "Based on Schrödinger's wave equation and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It is not derived from a single experiment, but from a mathematical formalism.",
  "schrodinger_limitations": "The model is mathematically complex and non-intuitive. The visualization of a 'cloud' is only a representation of the probability density, not a physical image of the atom.",
  "entanglement_title": "Quantum Entanglement (1935)",
  "entanglement_description": "A quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to each other, even though the individual objects may be spatially separated.",
  "entanglement_experiment": "Based on the EPR paradox (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) and later confirmed by Bell's theorem tests and Aspect's experiments.",
  "entanglement_limitations": "Counter-intuitive nature (spooky action at a distance), difficulty in maintaining coherence (decoherence), and challenges in scaling for quantum computing.",
  "entanglement_intro_text": "What if two particles behaved as one — even when separated?",
  "start_simulation": "Start Simulation",
  "classical_correlation_title": "Classical Correlation",
  "classical_correlation_desc": "In classical physics, correlation does not imply shared state. Changing one particle does not affect the other.",
